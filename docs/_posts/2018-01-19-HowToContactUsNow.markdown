I updated the [Contact]({{ site.url}}{{ site.ref_path }}/contact) information, from now on, the _preferred way to contact Opaali support_ is to use the [Contact Us]({{ site.opaali_contact }}) form on the [Opaali Portal]({{ site.opaali_portal}}).

The support responsibility is gradually being transferred from the _migration team_ to the normal _product support organization_.

There will be fewer people answering your questions, so the communication should be more efficient. Filling in the form makes it easier to include all the relevant information that is needed to process your _support request_.

![Contact US form]({{ site.url }}{{ site.ref_path }}/img/opaalicontact.png)
*Contact form before login*

If you have a user account to the Opaali Portal (_and if you are migrating from CGW, you really need to have it already!_) you should _log in_ before opening the Contact form, because then you will have __your user details filled in automatically__:

![Contact US form after login]({{ site.url }}{{ site.ref_path }}/img/opaalicontactloggedin.png)
*Contact form after login*

(_notice that the form will make you select your_ **Partner Id** (also known as Provider Id) _which is **the one piece of information that the support almost always needs** to be able to solve your problem_.)

## Sorry about the lousy Forum...

Apologies to those of you, _who have asked about something on the Opaali Forum but never received a reply_! We have been too busy to be monitoring if there is new discussion.

The _Opaali Forum_ was our first channel towards the users where we tried to give examples of using the _Opaali API_. That didn't work too well, as the _text formatting capabilities were very limited_. There was very little discussion and all the questions would have been more quickly answered by Opaali Support if they had been entered through the Contact Us form.

This [blog]({{ site.url }}) effectively replaced the Forum as our _information channel_ towards Opaali users. And the _opaali-tuki mailbox_ and the [Contact Us]({{ site.opaali_contact }}) form work much better as a _channel from you to us_. The Forum has not been closed down, but I don't encourage using it as those other channels work so much better. Maybe one day it will be replaced with a proper external discussion forum.

## The End is nearer...

By now, all _external CGW customers_ should already 
* have been migrated to Opaali
* or be near completing their migration to Opaali
* or have had their _service contract terminated_

Officially, support for _Content Gateway_ ended at the end of year 2017. Some individual customers have been granted more time if they are close to completion and have a solid plan for completing. If you haven't responded to Opaali support's requests to migrate, _your service has probably already been terminated_.

Internal Telia services are the last group to be migrated, and _the migration team_ will concentrate on that now. This means that _I will still write some more Blog Posts here_ (there is a long list of topics which I should cover...), and if there is _some technical detail you would like to ask about_ now is the time to use the [Contact Us]({{ site.opaali_contact }}) form and ask it!

We are also still planning to update the [sample applications on GitHub](https://github.com/MiiKos/Opaali/tree/master/sample_applications) with more functionality (_and bug fixes..._) but the last few months have been very busy for the migration team. 

I'm still not quite sure when **the day when CGW will be switched off** will be, but _the migration team leader_ is convinced that **that day will come**!
