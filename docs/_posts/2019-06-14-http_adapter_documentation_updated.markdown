Now that the _http\_adapter_ has been in production use for a while, I have finally updated some of the documentation. The [README.md](https://github.com/MiiKos/Opaali/blob/master/sample_applications/http_adapter/README.md) was updated and a new document [http_adapter_reference.md](https://github.com/MiiKos/Opaali/blob/master/sample_applications/http_adapter/http_adapter_reference.md) has been added. These documents are in _markdown_ format, you can view them formatted on GitHub but you may need a _markdown_ compatible tool to print them out correctly.

The _Reference Manual_ is mostly compiled from information presented in this blog, but formatted into a single document.

You can download the latest released build of the _http_adapter_ [here](https://github.com/MiiKos/Opaali/releases).
At the time of writing the latest build is v0.4.0-beta, which was released in February this year. It is in internal use for migrating a couple of old _Content Gateway_ based services, so there is a good chance that if/when bugs are discovered a fix will be released (_cannot promise anything, though_).
