<h2>What this blog is intended for...</h2>
<p>This is a blog about <i>Telia Operator Service Platform</i> <a href="{{site.opaali_portal}}"><b>Opaali</b></a> &ndash; specifically about its programming interface the <b>Opaali API</b>.
</p>
<p>There will be <i>example code snippets</i>  and <i>blog posts</i> explaining the code. There will also be a couple of <i>full applications</i> in <i>source code form</i> for you to use as almost drop-in replacements for some of the existing Content Gateway installations.</p>

<h3>Who are we?</h3>
Although this blog and the accompanying source code is maintained by the <i>Content Gateway to Opaali migration team</i>, this is <b>not part of the official Opaali product offering from Telia</b>. During the migration period the migration team will update the blog and code <i>irregularly</i>. What happens after the migration has completed and the migration team will have disbanded &ndash; we don't know yet. The usual disclaimers apply (<i>"Any opinions expressed here are those of the writer's and not..., you know"</i>). <b>The content of this GitHub repository comes AS IS with no guarantee from Telia whatsoever</b>.
