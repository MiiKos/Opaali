# HTTP adapter

This is a placeholder for an __HTTP adapter__ which will implement (as much as possible) the _Content Gateway HTTP interface_ for sending and receiving SMS messages.

The source code (written in _Java version 8_) will be published in several steps and the first version will have very limited functionality. The code will also be virtually untested at first (read: __very buggy__) so if you are not an adventurous mind you may be better off not trying to run the latest code by yourself.

This is work in progress. Eventually we hope this will result in a useful application that you can run in place of your current Content Gateway Provider Server. Or you can use it as an example while writing your own Java code.

And remember: _there will be __no__ official support for this code by Telia_!
